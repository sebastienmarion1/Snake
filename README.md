# Snake
This is a recreation of the iconic Google Snake Game. I made this game for a high school project and it took a couple of weeks to finish. It is a simple game that you can run on Python 3.10 (what I used). Note that the game itself as well as some comments in the code are in French, being that this game was created for a professor who speaks primarily French.
# Information Regarding the Game:
Start menu with a pause button, restart button, and the option to use WASD or arrow keys to move. Press the enter key to begin.

Goal: Get the highest score you can, and try and beat your record which saves and is displayed every time you play. Do this by eating the apples (red squares), and avoiding the purple squares.

Snake speeds up every time it eats an apple.

Random spawn locations for the snake as well as the apples.
